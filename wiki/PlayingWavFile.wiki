= How to play a wav file =

A minimal example of using the *aumiks* library to play a WAV file.

{{{
#include <ting/Thread.hpp> //for ting::Thread::Sleep()
#include <aumiks/WavSound.hpp>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
	//open audio device by creatig a singleton object.
	//We request stereo 44100KHz format and 100ms playing buffer.
	aumiks::Lib aumiksLibrary(100, aumiks::STEREO_16_44100);
	
	//load sound from WAV file
	ting::Ref<aumiks::WavSound> snd = aumiks::WavSound::LoadWAV("sample.wav");
	
	//In order to play the sound it is necessary to create a playing channel
	//for this sound using CreateChannel() method, and then start playback of
	//the created channel. The number of channels existing simultaneously is
	//not limited.
	//Some sound classes, like WavSound, provide convenience method Play() which
	//creates a channel and starts playing it.
	ting::Ref<aumiks::Channel> ch = snd->Play();
	
	//check if sound has finished playing every 50ms.
	while(ch->IsPlaying()){
		ting::Thread::Sleep(50);
	}
	
	return 0;
